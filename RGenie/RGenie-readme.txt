Ribald's Genie v3.0

Version 3.0 fix the GW fonction.

Version 2.8 is compatible with BG2EE/EET.

Version 2.x allows travelling to the Adventurers Mart, Trademeet and the Copper Coronet through a portal. It also allows trading with Ribald, Bernard and a Noble Merchant through the portal. Talk to ribald and ask him what other items he has that aren't on display. He will offer you an item to summon a genie (you must have talked to him 5 times for this to happen - a regular customer). The genie can't be summoned during combat, during chapter 5, after chapter 6 and several other locations (eg from the planar prison).


Why did I create this mod you ask (ok you probably didn't but anyway...)? Because I got tired of carting loads of junk around 
with my solo mage - continually having to travel to the adventurers mart to sell it all off. So Ribald's Genie was born.


Warning Note: If you sleep after being teleported to the Adventurers Mart or the other locations and a dream sequence starts 
you wont be able to teleport back to your previous location.
